To download the FEI dataset and the corresponding extracted CNN feature representations, used in the Ensemble clustering hands-on, please use the following link:

The representations are .h5 files (read using h5py)
Each .h5 representation file contains:
 - a "data" key (containing the features)
 - a "labels" key (containing the corresponding ground truth)
